                <p>To improve the effectiveness and usability of the Platform for our Users, we use "cookies", or such
                    similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a
                    User Identification (User ID) to understand the User's individual interests using the identified
                    computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g., through registration),
                    StockPe has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer.
                    The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie
                    cannot read data off the User's hard drive. StockPe‚Äôs advertisers may also assign their own cookies
                    to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that StockPe does not
                    control.

                <p>
                    StockPe's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection
                    to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits the Platform. (User's IP address
                    is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such
                    as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally.
                    StockPe uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor its Platform
                    to the interests of its users, to measure traffic within the Platform and let advertisers know the
                    geographic locations from where StockPe's visitors come.</p>
